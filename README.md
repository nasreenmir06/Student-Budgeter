# student-budgeter

## Purpose:
This is a React app also made with Bootstrap, Flask, and HTML. The purpose of this app is to collect a student's financial data and display an informative chart of the student's finances, along with providing them some useful suggestions regarding their budget and direct them to resources that they could consult to make more informative spending/saving decisions.
Budgeting is crucial for students because it helps them manage their limited financial resources effectively, avoid unnecessary debt, and build healthy financial habits early in life. By providing a tool that simplifies budgeting and offers personalized advice, I aim to assist students in making informed decisions with their finances.
